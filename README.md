# A weird spotify wrapper.

idk if any good will come from this "side" project
that's why we have the future i guess

# TODO

 - Make everything work with OOP
 - Finish the requests with a correct design patterns.
 - Implement all the spotify references from their website (most of that isn't implemented)
